Unity C# Solitaire Refactor

What We Built

A clean, SOLID‐compliant Unity implementation of a simple Solitaire-style card mover, featuring:

Domain Layer: CardModel and CardStack manage game state without any Unity dependencies.

Presentation Layer: CardStackPresenter and ICardView handle view hierarchy and card data binding, but defer animation.

Animation Layer: ICardAnimator abstraction (with a TweenCardAnimator implementation) centralizes movement logic.

Command System: ICommand implementations and a two-stack CommandManager provide full undo/redo support.

Game Service: GameService (formerly GameController) wires everything together, deals initial cards, handles clicks, and hooks up undo/redo UI.

What We’d Improve With More Time

Testing: Write unit tests for Domain (e.g. CardStack) and integration tests for commands to catch edge cases.

Dependency Injection: Introduce a DI container (e.g. Zenject) to simplify wiring—especially for swapping in alternative animators or stack implementations.

Robustness: Handle peek-only operations, invalid clicks, and transitions between empty/nonempty states more gracefully (e.g. disabled buttons, visual feedback).

Performance: Pool card views to avoid frequent instantiation/destruction during dealing or resets.

Features: Add full Solitaire rules (cascade piles, foundations), scoring, timers, hints, and a finish screen.

AI-Assisted Contributions

README & Documentation Drafting: AI helped outline key sections of the README and suggested phrasing to clearly convey project scope and future work.

Review & Refinement: Provided general recommendations on naming consistency, folder organization, and SOLID principles to guide the refactoring process.

Prompt-Based Brainstorming: Used targeted prompts to explore undo/redo strategies, command-pattern alternatives, and potential extension points.
